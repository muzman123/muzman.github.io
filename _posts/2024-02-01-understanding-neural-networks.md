# Understanding Neural Networks

Neural networks are the foundation of modern deep learning. Let's explore how they work.

## The Basics

A neural network is composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information:

1. **Input Layer** - Receives the raw data
2. **Hidden Layers** - Process and transform the data
3. **Output Layer** - Produces the final result

## How They Learn

Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation:

- Forward pass: Data flows through the network
- Loss calculation: Compare output to expected result
- Backward pass: Adjust weights to minimize error
- Repeat until the network is trained

## Applications

Neural networks are used in:

- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech synthesis
- Game playing
- And much more!

This is just scratching the surface. There's so much more to explore in this fascinating field.
