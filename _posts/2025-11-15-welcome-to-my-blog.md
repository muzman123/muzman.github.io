# Welcome!

Hello! This is my first blog post

## What is this page about?

This blog will serve to give an insight into my ideas, journey and struggles as i explore my various interests in the field of computer science. Stay tuned!

## Book List

I will be using this page to keep myself accountable with reading. You'll find my current reads, reading backlog, and completed books, plus posts diving into what I learned from books I've finished.

## Project Showcase

I will be posting showcase/deep dives into previously completed and future projects.

## Disclaimer

Every blog post on this page is written without AI language model assistance as I want to truly recount MY OWN thoughts, not AI's, and use these blogs as a means to practice my writing. Grammar checking is fair game though.
